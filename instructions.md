Once you have the PCB and all the parts, you can start assembling them.

(1) start with the Pro Micro. Get a breadboard (if needed) and solder the headers on to the board.

(2) Grab the PCB and solder the Pro Micro with headers onto the PCB.

(3) solder all the smd components. This is best done with solder flux and a heat gun, but a thin tip will work too.

(4) solder the Cherry Mx Switches one by one.

(5) once all the parts are soldered, go to the Arduino app (if you don't have it, you can use the web version, but the app works better)

(6) download the Adafuit NeoPixel libary and also select the board (Arduino Leonardo) and the COMM port.

(7) once done, you can flash it

(8) that's it! have fun building and you can customize the code.
